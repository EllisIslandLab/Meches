3. Add product images to match the filenames in `script.js`
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser

### 2. Square Payment Integration

5. For production, change to production environment

### 3. Airtable Integration
1. Create an Airtable account at [airtable.com](https://airtable.com)
2. Create a base with tables:
   - `General_Inquiries` (Name, Email, Phone, Subject, Message, Type, Timestamp)
   - `Custom_Orders` (Name, Email, Phone, Product Type, Colors, Materials, Size, Quantity, Budget, Deadline, Description, Inspiration, Type, Timestamp)
   - 'Orders' (Order ID, Customer Name, Email, Phone, Address, Order Items, Subtotal, Shipping, Tax,

   const AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = 'your_base_id_here';
   ```
5. Uncomment the actual API call code and remove simulation code

### 4. Product Customization
Edit the `products` array in `script.js` to add your own products:
```javascript
{

    name: "Your Product Name",
    price: 25.00,
    image: "your-image.jpg",
    category: "your-category",

}
```
